## [Project 1: Predicting Drivers' Coupon Acceptance](https://github.com/kelvinsima2/coupon_predictor/blob/main/Coursework1.ipynb)

- This project involves the use of the in-vehicle coupon recommendation dataset available on the UCI machine learning repository to predict whether a driver would accept a coupon based on various conditions.
- SVM, KNN, Decision Tree and AdaBoost classification models were evaluated to determine which model was most accurate in the predictions.
- For each classification algorithm, hyperparameters were tuned to achieve maximum performance, for example, the number of nearest neighbours in the KNN algorithm was tuned as shown in Figure 1.
- The SVM algorithm had the highest accuracy and F1 score, making it the best model.
- The full written report for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/kelvinsima2/coupon_predictor/blob/main/report_F134712.pdf).
